# Below example shows how to escape single quotes or double quotes in a string using the backslash.
print("The pet shop owner said, \"No, No 'e 's... uh, He's resting\". ")

# Or we can print the above line like this.

print('The pet shop owner said, "No, No \'e \'s... uh, He\'s resting." ')
# We can also use the triple quotes like this which will not require us to use the backslash.
print("""The pet shop owner said, "No, No 'e 's... uh, He's resting". """)
