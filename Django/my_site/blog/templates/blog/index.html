            Hi! I am Deepanshu. I love to blog about tech and the world! My favourite programming language is Python.
            I love to learn programming and would like to have my own product developed someday.

                                There is nothing like the views you get when hiking in the mountains.
                                And I wasn't even prepared for what happened whilst I was enjoying the views!
