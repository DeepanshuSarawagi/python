insert into contacts (name, phone, email) values('Deepanshu', 654396, 'deepanshu@email.com'); -> Insert data into the
table.

SELECT * FROM contacts;  -> To query the data from the table.

INSERT INTO contacts VALUES("Rajat", 654397, "rajat@email.com");  -> Alternate way to add data in table without
specifying the fields.

INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone) VALUES("Divya", 87654);  -> Insert only data for specific columns/fields in a table.

.backup testbackup -> backup database; syntax (.backup backupfilename)

UPDATE contacts SET email="steve@hisemail.com";  -> Updates all the email address of all the contacts in contacts table.

.restore testbackup  -> to restore from backup database

UPDATE contacts SET email="divya@email.com" WHERE name = "Divya";  -> To update data of a specific contact in a table.

 SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE name="Deepanshu";  -> To query records of a specific row by specifying the WHERE CLAUSE.

 DELETE FROM contacts WHERE name="Divya";  -> Delete a record from the table.

sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE songs (_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, track INTEGER, title TEXT NOT NULL, album INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE albums (_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, artist INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE artists (_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL);

Here TEXT NOT NULL denotes that we need to specify the data for this field and we cannot leave it empty.

SELECT * FROM artists ORDER BY name;  -> To display the records sorted/ordered by a particular column/field

SELECT * FROM albums ORDER BY name COLLATE NOCASE;  -> To display the ordered/sorted records ignoring case.

SELECT * FROM albums ORDER BY name COLLATE NOCASE DESC;  -> -> To display the ordered/sorted records ignoring case in
descending order.

SELECT * FROM albums ORDER BY artist, name COLLATE NOCASE;  -> Displays the sorted albums by sorting first with artist_id,
and then by album names by all that artist_id.

SELECT * FROM songs ORDER BY album, track COLLATE NOCASE;  -> List all the songs so that the songs from the same album
appear together in track order.

SELECT songs.track, songs.title, albums.name FROM songs JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id;  -> Join two tables in
a Database.
